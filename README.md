# NaviProgrammingLanguage
A collection of files that contain a compiler, header file, and a STM file that runs the Navi Language. 

# small description for how it works
The header file and compiler should exist in the same location. If I were to create a text file using the syntax rules for Navi Programming Language, I could save that file as a .navi file and run it through the compiler. The compiler created different files that can now be used in the STM file. Once they are run, the program created in the text file now works.
